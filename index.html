        <h2>Release of Liability</h2>
            <button type="button" class="collapsible">Click to read</button>
            <div class="content">
<p>This is a WAIVER AND RELEASE OF LIABILITY (this “Release”) for injury, illness, permanent disability, and death for the individual specified below (the “Participant”) arising from and/or during participation in Student Ministry activities including but not limited to tubing at Rock Springs State Park and other ad hoc gatherings (hereinafter, all are the “Activity”).  But for this Release, these activities would not occur in light of the cost and burden of defending such claims.<br><br><br>

A.	General Acknowledgments and Release.<br><br>

I, on my own behalf and on behalf of my child, the child’s other parent or guardians, heirs, executors, administrators, assigns, or personal representatives (hereinafter, collectively, “Releasor”), hereby (i) waive any and all rights, claims or causes of action against First Presbyterian Church of Orlando, Inc, a Florida nonprofit corporation (“FPCO”) and its affiliates, elders, officers, managers, members, agents, employees, attorneys, staff, volunteers, representatives, successors, assigns and any one/entity for which FPCO would be vicariously/derivatively liable (collectively, “Releasees”) of any kind arising out of any participation in the Activity, (ii) release and forever discharge Releasees from any and all liability that Participant may suffer or incur as a result of any participation in the Activity, and, (iii) covenant and agree not to sue or otherwise bring any claim or otherwise bring any claim regardless of theory of recovery (e.g. tort, negligence, Releasees own negligence, breach of contract, and the like) against Releasees arising out of or related to the Activity.<br><br>
I understand and agree that this release includes a release of (a) any claims based on the actions, omissions, including without limitation the negligence of FPCO or any of the other Releasees, and (b) any claims based on contracting any illness, including, without limitation, COVID-19 (defined and dealt with further below), whether such illness or infection occurs before, during, or after participation in the Activity arising from or related to the Activity.  Further:<br><br>

	I UNDERSTAND THAT FPCO IS A RELIGIOUS, NON-PROFIT INSTITUTION.<br><br>

	I VOLUNTARILY AGREE TO LET MY MINOR CHILD PARTICIPATE IN THE ACTIVITY ENTIRELY AT MY AND MY CHILD’S OWN RISK. <br><br>

	I AM AWARE AND DO HEREBY RELEASE RELEASEES FOR AND FROM THEIR OWN NEGLIGENCE.<br><br>

	I AM AWARE OF THE RISK OF INJURY BY PARTICIPATING IN THE ACTIVITY, WHICH MAY INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO: PHYSICAL OR PSYCHOLOGICAL INJURY, PAIN, SUFFERING, ILLNESS (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, CONTRACTING COVID-19 OR OTHER DISEASE), DISFIGUREMENT, TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT DISABILITY (INCLUDING PARALYSIS), ECONOMIC OR EMOTIONAL LOSS, AND DEATH. <br><br>

	I UNDERSTAND THAT THESE INJURIES OR OUTCOMES MAY ARISE FROM MY OWN, MY CHILD’S, RELEASEES’ OR OTHERS’ NEGLIGENCE, CONDITIONS RELATED TO TRAVEL TO AND FROM THE ACTIVITY, OR FROM CONDITIONS AT THE ACTIVITY LOCATION(S) INCLUDING FAILURE TO USE OR PROPERLY USE SAFETY EQUIPMENT, FAILURE TO USE OR PROPERLY USE PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT, FAILURE TO MAINTAIN A SAFE DISTANCE, FAILING TO PROPERLY SANITIZE OR CLEAN, AND THE LIKE.<br><br>

	I FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGE THAT RELEASEES ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ERRORS, OMISSIONS, ACTS, AND/OR FAILURES TO ACT OF ANY PARTY OR ENTITY CONDUCTING AN EVENT ON BEHALF OF RELEASEES.<br><br><br>

B.	COVID-19 Acknowledgment and Release.<br><br>
The 2019 novel coronavirus and associated illness (“COVID-19”), has been declared a worldwide pandemic by the World Health Organization (the “WHO”). The WHO and the American Center for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) have confirmed that COVID-19 is highly contagious and is capable of spreading through person-to-person contact via airborne transmission, physical contact with an infected person, and/or by contact with the same surfaces as affected by an infected person.  Further, research and a scientific understanding of COVID-19 is incomplete such that there may be other ways in which the virus spreads that are not currently known or understood.  The likelihood of spreading and/or contracting COVID-19 is increased as respiration increases such as with and during Activity and also increases with physical contact with or being in close proximity to others such as may occur during the Activity.  While FPCO takes precautionary steps to reduce the likelihood of transmission of COVID-19, no steps may be taken that are guaranteed to be 100% effective at preventing the spread of COVID-19. Other diseases such as staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus or “MRSA”), various strains of influenza and other communicable diseases may also be contracted and/or transmitted by partaking in Activity.<br><br>

a)	Health Problems, Permanent Injury/Disability and Death<br><br>

Should my child contract COVID-19, or another disease, as a result of participating in Activity, I understand that I may contract such disease from my child, and that other family members or persons who come in contact with or are in proximity to my child (or me) may also contract COVID-19 or such other disease.  Disease, including without limitation, COVID-19, may be spread even while a person who is infected with the diseases shows no, or very mild, symptoms.  <br><br>
COVID-19, and other diseases, may cause serious health problems, permanent injury/disability and death.<br><br>

b)	Release, Waiver and Assumption of the Risk<br><br>

With the foregoing in mind and fully understood by me, to the fullest extent permitted by law with respect to contracting COVID-19 or other disease/illness, I hereby (i) waive any and all rights, claims or causes of action against Releasees of any kind arising out of any participation in the Activity, (ii) release and forever discharge Releasees from any and all liability that Participant may suffer or incur as a result of any participation in the Activity, and, (iii) covenant and agree not to sue or otherwise bring any claim regardless of theory of recovery (e.g. tort, negligence, breach of contract, and the like) against Releasees regardless of theory of recovery (e.g. tort, negligence, Releasees’ own negligence, breach of contract, and the like).  Further, I assume the risk, waive liability, and release/discharge Releasees from any claim:<br><br>

i)	The child may have for contracting COVID-19, or any other disease, arising from or related to the child’s participation in Activity.<br><br>

ii)	The child’s siblings, other parent or guardians may have for contracting COVID-19, or any other disease, from the child, arising from or related to participation in Activity.<br><br>

iii)	I may have arising from the child contracting COVID-19, or any other disease, arising from or related to participation in Activity.<br><br>

iv)	I may have arising from my contracting COVID-19, or any other disease, from the child, arising from or related to participation in Activity.<br><br>

Further, I specifically agree, warrant and represent that:<br><br>

v)	I am releasing the Releasees from their own negligence with respect to Activity arising from or related to COVID -19, or any other disease.<br><br>

vi)	By signing this document I have authority to sign for and bind my child’s other parent and/or guardians and to sign and bind on behalf of the child’s siblings.<br><br>

vii)	By signing this document, I will defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Releasees from any third-party claims arising from or related to the child’s participation in Activity and contracting COVID-19, or any other disease.  This Section B(b)(vii) does not apply to the child’s claims or the claims of the siblings of the child, if any, against the Releasees.  This Section B(b)(vii), also applies to claims not related to COVID, or disease, that are otherwise addressed in Section A, above in that defense, indemnity and hold harmless are required of the parent guardian for claims covered by Section A, but not for claims of the child or child’s sibling(s) covered by Section A.<br><br><br>

C.	Medical Payment.<br><br>

If my child should require medical care or treatment, I authorize FPCO to provide all emergency medical care deemed necessary, including but not limited to, first aid, CPR, emergency medical transport, and sharing of medical information with medical personnel. I further agree to assume all costs involved and agree to be financially responsible for any costs incurred as a result of such treatment. I am aware and understand that I should carry health insurance for my child or be prepared to pay out-of-pocket for such treatment.<br><br><br>

D.	Miscellaneous.<br><br>

I agree that this Release shall be governed for all purposes by Florida law, without regard to any conflict of law principles. This Release supersedes any and all previous oral or written promises or other agreements.<br><br>

I agree to follow any and all instructions of the leaders of the Activity as a condition of my participation in the Activity. In the event that any damage to equipment or facilities occurs as a result of any of Releasor’s willful, neglect or reckless actions, I acknowledge and agree to be held liable for any and all costs associated with any such willful, neglect or reckless actions.<br><br>
THIS RELEASE SHALL REMAIN IN EFFECT FOR THE DURATION OF MY CHILD’S PARTICIPATION IN THE ACTIVITY, DURING THIS INITIAL EVENT AND ALL SUBSEQUENT EVENTS OF PARTICIPATION.<br><br>

This Release is entered into at arm’s-length, without duress or coercion, and is to be interpreted as an agreement between two parties of equal bargaining strength. I agree that this Release is clear and unambiguous as to its terms, and that it contains the entire agreement between me and FPCO with respect to the subject matter hereof.<br><br>

Each of the Releasees shall be intended third party beneficiaries of this Release with the right to enforce this Release as if they were parties to this Release.<br><br>

In the event that any provision contained within this Release shall be deemed to be severable or invalid, or if any term, condition, phrase or portion of this Release shall be determined to be unlawful or otherwise unenforceable, the remainder of this Release shall remain in full force and effect. If a court should find any provision of this Release to be invalid or unenforceable, but by limiting said provision it would become valid and enforceable, then said provision shall be deemed to be written, construed and enforced as so limited.<br><br>

<br><br>
I CERTIFY THAT I HAVE READ THIS AGREEMENT, AND THAT I FULLY UNDERSTAND ITS CONTENT. I AM AWARE THAT THIS IS A RELEASE AND WAIVER OF LIABILITY, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION FOR RELEASEES’ OWN NEGLIGENCE, AND THAT I AM SIGNING IT OF MY OWN FREE WILL.<br><br>
I CERTIFY that I am the parent or legal guardian of the Participant named above and do hereby execute this Waiver on behalf of the Participant and fully consent and agree to its terms.</p>
